### Main requirements

DCSPlan is a planning tool for flight simulation, especially DCS.

- Display a scrollable and zoomable map
- The map data (including tiles) is specific and will be served by the app's back-end
- The user will be able to draw a flight path on the map with several legs. The app will calculate bearing and distance for each leg
- The back-end will be able to generate and export a "knee-board" with each leg of the flight plan, the corresponding map extract (appropriately scaled and rotated) and relevant info
- As the map is specific, it must offer a way to configure the right projection and reference coordinate to make the right calculations
- The user will be able to import a specific flight plan from a DCS mission file
