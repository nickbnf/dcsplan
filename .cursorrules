# DCSPlan Project Rules

## Testing
- **Always run tests after making changes**: After modifying backend code, run `pnpm test:backend` to ensure all tests pass
- When in doubt, run the full test suite to catch regressions

## Code Organization
- Backend validation and generation logic should be kept in `packages/backend/kneeboard.py`
- FastAPI route definitions belong in `packages/backend/main.py`
- Unit tests should be comprehensive and cover error conditions

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to the codebase
2. **Run tests** (`pnpm test` or `pnpm test:backend`)
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Commit changes

## Backend Structure
- Use Pydantic models for validation in `kneeboard.py`
- Keep business logic separate from API routes
- Write tests for every new function, especially error cases
